# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights using summary statistics and visualizations.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Tasks Performed
1. **Summary Statistics**: Calculated mean, median, standard deviation, and other descriptive metrics.
2. **Visualizations**:
   - **Histograms** to understand distributions of numerical features.
   - **Boxplots** to detect outliers and spread of the data.
3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Generated a **correlation matrix** to identify relationships between variables.
   - Created a **pairplot** to visually explore feature interactions.
4. **Pattern & Trend Recognition**:
   - Analyzed survival rate by gender and passenger class.
   - Identified data skewness and feature distributions.
5. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Filled missing values for Age, Embarked, and Cabin.
   - Converted categorical variables to numeric using encoding.
   - Dropped irrelevant or redundant columns.

## 💡 Key Insights
- **Women** had a significantly higher survival rate than men.
- **1st class** passengers had better chances of survival.
- **Fare** was highly skewed, indicating outliers among wealthier passengers.
- **Age** was slightly right-skewed with a concentration of passengers in their 20s and 30s.
